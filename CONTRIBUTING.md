# Contributing to Milton

You can contribute to the bot by adding an extension that does something cool.
Extensions should be put in the `cogs` folder and loaded in the `bot.py` script.
More information on how to correctly write extensions can be found in the [`discord.py` documentation](https://discordpy.readthedocs.io/en/latest/).

I welcome and will review all pull requests. 

## Setting up for development
To setup for developing Milton, you will need `python 3.11` installed. [Follow the standard GitHub contributing workflow](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/quickstart/contributing-to-projects).

Remember to install pre-commit (I suggest installing it to the system-wide installation) with `pip install pre-commit` and setting it up with `pre-commit install` before committing. Pre-commit will handle setting code style and whatnot.
