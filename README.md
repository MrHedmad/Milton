## About

This is a Discord bot mainly aimed at managing a research laboratory Discord Server. It has specific features designed with research and a laboratory in mind.

The bot uses a local [SQLite](https://https://www.sqlite.org/index.html/) database to store its data.

## Deploy your own instance

There are two ways to run your own instance of Milton:
1. Install `python 3.10` or later and `git`. I assume that `python` points to the Python 3.11 interpreter;
2. Optionally, but highly advised, make a virtual environment and enter it `python -m venv env`, then activate it `source env/bin/activate`.
3. Install the bot with `pip install git+https://github.com/MrHedmad/Milton.git@release`.
4. Configure the bot, such as adding your bot token (see below).
5. Run the bot by executing `milton` (while in the `env`).

To re-run the bot after you install it, run `milton` again while in the virtual environment. 

### Configuration

Create a `config.yml` (and not `.yaml`!) in `~/.milton/` and add your specific configuration for the bot, overriding any configs in the `default-config.yml` file. Note that the structure of the file must be identical to the first (I suggest copy-pasting it and changing what you need/like: from the Milton folder, `mkdir ~/.milton/ && cp ./milton/default-config.yml ~/.milton/config.yml`).

One config you must override is the `bot > token` field, providing your own [discord bot token](https://discord.com/developers/applications).
