# Changelog
This is Milton's changelog.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/),
and this project adheres to (something like) [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

Since the bot has no API, the Semantic versioning will follow this general guidelines:

- **MAJOR**: Incremented when several new cogs or systems are added, code has been restructured, or large database changes that affect most of the bot's structure. Also incremented when the bot reaches a long-term stable 'release'.
- **MINOR**: Incremented when commands or cogs are added or modified as to change how they are invoked by the users.
- **PATCH**: Incremented when bugfixes are added or the implementation changes without any modification on the bot's functionality.

### [Unreleased]
- Added basic cogs.
  - `cli`, `toys`, `help`, `welcome`
- Basic paginator.
- Started using a Json "database". Hopefully I won't regret it later.
- Setup readme, changelog and todo files
